### Hi, I'm Evan A. Valdes 

- I'm a Social Psychology PhD student at [Massey University](https://www.massey.ac.nz/)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis titled "Investigating the cross-cultural differences of categorical thinking on system justification: Implications for Socioeconomic status, political identity, and life satisfaction" 

- âœ¨ My research interests intersect the topic of cross-cultural, political, and social psychology as well as intergroup relations. Outside of my thesis, I have a couple of projects exploring status legitimacy effects and cultural and identity based differences in vaccine hesitancy.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects relating to intergroup relations, categorical thinking and conflict
